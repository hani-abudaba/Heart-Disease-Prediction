Heart disease, a prevalent global health concern, can benefit from data-driven insights. Leveraging machine learning, we aim to predict heart disease occurrence by analyzing medical histories, physiological measurements, and lifestyle factors. Through model training and evaluation, our study seeks to accurately differentiate patients with and without heart disease. Challenges include data quality and model complexity, demanding iterative refinement. This research aligns with the growing need for early detection, intervention, and personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving cardiovascular healthcare outcomes.
